# iOS Networking

![Platform iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nanodegree-iOS-blue.svg)

This repository contains resources for Udacity's iOS Networking with Swift course.

## Overview

iOS Networking teaches foundational principles of networking and how they are applied in an iOS-context. The course uses a series of example applications and playgrounds as demonstrations:

- Prereqs (associated values, errors, generics, guards)
- URLPlayground
- ImageRequest
- Randog
- HouseJSON
- JSONParsingExercises
- TheMovieManager

Each application has a "complete" version which is already fully-implemented.

## Movie Manager Challenge

The issue tracker has many issues labeled `moviemanagerchallenge`. These are challenges presented at the end of "Lesson 7: Common Networking Challenges". While not intended to be "fixed" in the completed version of the Movie Manager, you're welcome to share your approach on how you addressed them on the individual issues.

## Setup

Generally speaking, most projects can run without any additional setup. However, consult the iOS Networking with Swift course for more information.
